First I had a short phone interview about my interests, experience and the company. Then, I was sent a 6 hours programming test to be done in C++. Then, I was invited to a face-to-face interview, which included going over my programming test and solving a problem on whiteboard. I received a good offer soon after this. Unfortunately I had to decline the offer for personal/family reasons.

**Interview Questions**

- Something like a message passing framework, with performance/readability requirements

The first step was a phone screen with the technical hiring manager. Most of the questions revolved around technical concepts, features of C++, and how they influenced design choices. The next step was a six-hour programming exercise -- I was emailed ==a problem statement and API stub, and required to implement the API.== The final step was a 6-round interview. The first interviewer was the HR Director -- he spent probably half his time explaining the company and its products, and half the time on behavioral questions. I then interviewed with five senior level technical staff, from the CTO on down. All of them focused on technical questions, some more conceptual, some more detailed. One of them involved a typical virtual whiteboard coding exercise, and one was devoted to going over my code from the coding test. The company let me drive the timing between interviews -- which was slower at first, then accelerated quickly once I had other offers.

**Interview Questions**

- What are good use cases for shared_ptr? What are some bad use cases?

The interview process began with a phone screen with the EVP of the engineering team. This is your standard phone screening interview where the interviewer is looking to align your skillset & experience with their requirements. While this won't really be a technical round per se, the conversation will remain fairly technical. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised when the discussion touched upon schema of a Time-series Database that I had mentioned on my resume. The next stage is an offline coding test. The test isn't an abstract algorithms question, but a real world design + optimization problem that aligns well with the role. You're not only expected to solve the question, but also prove the correctness of your solution (for various cases that you can think of) The final stage was a virtual onsite interview. This will most likely be a multi-round interview; in my case, there were 5 rounds with one interviewer per round. One of the rounds was with the global director of HR. One of the purposes of this interview is to determine if you're a good cultural fit for the organization. I was told about the perks & benefits that come with the position, along with the various team building events that are organized every year (with the exception of the peak COVID-19 impacted years). The other rounds involved directors, engineers and the CTO of the company. These rounds were entirely technical. These rounds included ==a live coding challenge, review & optimization of the offline coding test submitted previously, and discussion of topics from general C++, STL, Boost, data structures, networking, and operating systems.== Regardless of the type of the interview, all the interviewers were extremely courteous, and will encourage you with helpful suggestions if you get stuck on a question. At certain points I was quite impressed with the depth & range of the interviewers' knowledge on various topics.

**Interview Questions**

- The interview is secured by an NDA, so I cannot divulge the questions.

Bad experience - was asked to build a complex solution as a take home assignment after a brief interview with their EVP of Technology. I developed a complete working project based on their specs. OneZero never confirmed that they received it and ignored all of my subsequent emails. I understand that as a Fin-Tech startup they might be operating in a fast-paced environment, and things can slip through the cracks, but not giving acknowledgement that they received the assignment back seems like a disrespect for one's time and effort. For the interview process - I filled out application, we exchanged emails with they receptionist to arranged a half-hour phone interview with EVP of Technology. The interview with OneZero EVP of Techn was a standard intro interview - went over the platform that OneZero was building and my past experience. At the interview I've been told that we had a good match, and was offered to do a take home assignment as the next step in the interview process. I said that I'd need to work on clearing my schedule before I could commit to the take home assignment, and had some reservations, as it seemed like a very disproportionate and one-sided commitment of time and effort. However OneZero receptionist followed up with me several times in the next week and a half, and I eventually agreed to do it - clearing a full day to dedicate to it. On the day of the assignment the receptionist emailed it to me, and then followed up to confirm that I was good to go. The assignment was to ==build a stand-alone message routing / subscription service and add unit testing framework to verify that it was working to the specifications.== It felt like a fairly complex project, but I've had experience in that field, and implemented everything that was in the requirements - tested it out and emailed back a finished solution before the end of the day. I believe that the solution I've provided was complete, efficient and robust. OneZero never acknowledged that they got the assignment back. I emailed receptionist a few times afterward to confirm, but never got a reply. After this experience, I will not bother doing day-long take home assignments, unless company is willing to pay for it. Would also avoid dealing with OneZero and similar startups.
