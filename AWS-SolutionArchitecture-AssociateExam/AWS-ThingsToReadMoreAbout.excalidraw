You will need to add rules to account for each port.\n            b. Port Range: Enter 32768-61000, Destination: Enter The CIDR block of your public subnet\n\n        create rules with rule numbers that are multiples of 100. This can help with organization if you need to insert new rules, as there is room within the numbering scheme.\n        NACLs are stateless i.e they cannot tell if a message is in response to a request that started inside the VPC, or if it is a request that started from the internet. \n        Hence, a NACL is better suited for private subnets. \n        For public subnets, using security groups is recommended without NACLs.\n        each subnet must be associated with a network ACL. \n        If you do not explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL that allows all inbound and outbound traffic.\n        By default, a network ACL is not associated with a subnet until you explicitly associate it with one. \n        Changes to NACLs may take longer to propagate, as opposed to security groups, which take effect almost immediately. \n\n    network address translation(NAT) device: \n        EC2 instances that you launch into a private subnet in a virtual private cloud (VPC) can't communicate with the Internet. \n        You can use a network address translation (NAT) instance in a public subnet in your VPC, to enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the Internet, \n        but prevent the instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the internet. you should configure the route table in the private subnet to associate the instances use the NAT gateway in same AV.\n        When sending response traffic to the instances, the NAT device translates the addresses back to the original source IPv4 addresses.    \n        Common scenario: \n        You want maximum security on the production database servers, so you put them in a private subnet (no route to the internet). \n        Yet you need the ability to perform operating system updates on the D\\B servers.  \n        They cannot connect to the internet, so they cannot receive needed updates.  \n        By adding a default route to a NAT, the database servers can connect to the internet and receive updates. \n        However, they are still secure because no connection originating from the internet can reach them.\n\nEC2\n    public subnet\n        NACL\n            inbound: allow port 443 on destination 0.0.0.0/0\n            outbound: \n                allow port 443 on destination 0.0.0.0/0, \n                allow ports 32768-65535(ephemeral ports) on destination 0.0.0.0/0, \n                deny all traffic on destination 0.0.0.0/0\n    Security group has attached Elastic IP address\n        allow inbound traffic on port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0\n        default SG includes a outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic.

EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an EC2 instance.\n    When you create an EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated within that zone to prevent data loss due to a failure of any single hardware component.\n    After you create a volume, you can attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone\n    Amazon EBS Multi-Attach enables you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volume to multiple Nitro-based instances that are in the same Availability Zone. However, other EBS types are not supported.\n    An EBS volume is off-instance storage that can persist independently from the life of an instance. You can specify not to terminate the EBS volume when you terminate the EC2 instance during instance\n    creation.\n    EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production which means that you can modify volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.\n    EBS encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithms (AES-256)\n    EBS Volumes offer 99.999% SLA.\n    provides the ability to create snapshots (backups) of any EBS volume and write a copy of the data in the volume to Amazon S3\n\nStorage needs and AWS service:\n    Temporary storage: Amazon local instance store\n    Multi Instance storage: Amazon EFS\n    Highly durable storage: Amazon S3, Amazon EFS\n    Static data or web content: Amazon S3, Amazon EFS\n",

The identity store which is currently being used is not compatible with SAML.\n    Develop an on-premises custom identity broker application and use STS to issue short-lived AWS credentials.\n    => application verifies that employees are signed into the existing corporate network’s identity and authentication system, which might use LDAP, Active Directory, or another system. The identity broker\n    application then obtains temporary security credentials for the employees. \n    To get temporary security credentials, the identity broker application calls either AssumeRole or GetFederationToken to obtain temporary security credentials, depending on how you want to manage\n    the policies for users and when the temporary credentials should expire. The call returns temporary security credentials consisting of an AWS access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token. The\n    identity broker application makes these temporary security credentials available to the internal company application. The app can then use the temporary credentials to make calls to AWS directly. The app caches\n    the credentials until they expire, and then requests a new set of temporary credentials.\nSet up SAML 2.0-Based Federation by using a Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS):\n    you must configure your organization’s IdP and your AWS account to trust each other. \n    then users can log into the AWS Management Console or call the AWS APIs without you having to create an IAM user for everyone in your organization, by using SAML\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
