- Start with the basics: Check for basic coding standards, like proper naming conventions, indentation, and comments. Ensure that the code adheres to the principles of SOLID and the best practices of the Spring framework.
- Review the dependencies: Spring Boot manages dependencies automatically using its starter packs. Check for any unwanted dependencies that might affect the performance of the application.
- Check the configuration files: Review the application.yml or application.properties file to ensure that the application is configured correctly. Ensure that the environment-specific properties are being loaded properly and the properties are not hardcoded.
- Validate the use of annotations: Spring Boot heavily uses annotations for configuration, auto-wiring, and other purposes. Validate the use of these annotations and ensure that they are being used correctly.
- Analyze the architecture: Review the overall architecture of the application and ensure that it follows a standard design pattern like MVC or Hexagonal Architecture. Ensure that the code is modular and follows the single responsibility principle.
- Review security: Review the security configurations to ensure that the application is secure. Check for proper usage of Spring Security and other security libraries.
- Validate the database: Review the database configuration and ensure that the queries are optimized, the connections are pooled properly, and the transactions are being handled correctly.
- Test the code: Finally, test the code to ensure that it is working as expected. Write unit tests to validate the functionality of each component of the application.
