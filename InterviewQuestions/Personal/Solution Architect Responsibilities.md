As a solution architect, you need to consider several web application issues when designing an application. Some of these issues include:

1.  Security: Web application security is one of the most critical issues that a solution architect should consider. You need to ensure that the application is secure from various types of cyber-attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and CSRF attacks.
    
2.  Scalability: You need to ensure that the web application can handle a large number of users and can scale easily as the user base grows. You should also ensure that the application can handle high traffic loads and can be easily scaled horizontally.
    
3.  Performance: A slow web application can result in a poor user experience. You need to ensure that the application is optimized for performance and can handle large amounts of data without slowing down.
    
4.  Usability: The web application should be user-friendly and easy to use. You should ensure that the user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, and that the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
    
5.  Integration: The web application should be able to integrate with other systems and applications. You should ensure that the application can communicate with other systems using standard protocols and can exchange data seamlessly.
    
6.  Maintenance: You need to consider how the web application will be maintained and updated over time. You should ensure that the application is designed in a way that makes it easy to maintain and update without causing downtime or disrupting the user experience.
    
7.  Compliance: You need to ensure that the web application is compliant with various regulations and standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. You should also ensure that the application meets industry best practices and guidelines.
    
8.  Availability: The web application should be highly available and accessible to users at all times. You should ensure that the application is designed with redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure maximum uptime.
