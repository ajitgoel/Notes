1.**"Tell me a little about yourself,"** is often the first question. Interviewers don’t want your life story; they want to know if meeting you would be a good use of their time. Answer with a brief work history showing how each job and project helped prepare you for this job. Then give a profile of the "professional you," showcasing your skills in a way that will have the interviewer mentally picturing you doing the same things for him.  
2.“**What experience do you have in…**?” Make any discussion of your experience relevant to the deliverables of this particular job, and reference the specific skills you possess that enable you to do it well. At its core, this job exists to help the company make money in some way; and your work helps achieve this goal by solving problems and preventing problems from arising within your areas of responsibility. Your answers should show that you are a problem solver (and problem preventer) by nature, and that this problem prevention and solution attitude is always part of your thinking. You do this by giving concrete examples of problem identification and solution.

3."**What are your strengths**?" Whatever your particular strengths, you want to get these three points across:
==•You have the specific technical skills needed to do the job well.
•You have a problem-prevention-and-solution mindset.
•You are fully aware that the product of your work (that sale, that accounting report) in turn becomes part of someone else’s work. You understand your work is one small but important cog in the complex machinery that helps the company make money.==
4."**What are your weaknesses**?” You can safely—and honestly—say that ==your greatest weakness is finding time to stay current with all the new technology skills required in your work.== This is a challenge for everyone, so you’re neither lying nor making yourself seem “less than.” Then you must be ready to end your answer with examples of how you’ve been proactive in combating this deficiency.
5.“**How much do you want**?” If the interviewer asks about money, say that at this point you don't know enough about the company or the job to answer accurately. If you are pressed give a range, say, =="I have no real understanding of your needs yet, or of the different benefits that could come from joining your team. However, I would probably be looking at something in the range of $X-$Y."==
\1. Prepare as though it’s an in-person interview. Despite the fact that phone interviews are commonplace nowadays, some applicants fail to treat them as an essential part of the search process. Devote as much time to prepping for a phone meeting as you would for an initial meeting in person. Los Angeles executive and career coach David Couper, author of Outsiders on the Inside: How to Create a Winning Career… Even When You Don’t Fit In!, recommends having a written list of 5-10 stories about yourself that illustrate your accomplishments. “If you say you managed a department with five
people, you need to have a story about that,” advises Couper, who used to work in human resources at now-defunct consulting giant Arthur Andersen. “You can say, there was one person working for me, and I put forth a proposal for more staff, which was granted and we increased sales by X amount.” The stories should have a beginning, middle and end, says Couper.
\2. If the call comes out of the blue, say you’re in the middle of something and set a time to talk. If you get a call without a warning in advance, say you’re delighted to talk to the interviewer, but could you speak later, and suggest a time. Even if it’s just 15 minutes later, you need to gather your résumé, your notes and your thoughts.
\3. Make sure you’re in a quiet place with a good connection where you won’t be interrupted. Use a land line if possible. If you’re talking on a cell phone, let the interviewer know. and apologize in advance for any service interruption. Make sure children, pets and other possible interruptions are out of the room. Get yourself a glass of water.
\4. Ask how much time the interviewer has to talk. This will help you pace yourself and cover the ground you’re planning in the interview.
\5. ==Stand up and smile==. Standing knocks your energy level up a notch. When you smile, it affects your tone of voice and can make a more favorable impression. Some people find it useful to dress nicely, to put them in a professional state of mind. Imagine standing, dressed in a suit, as opposed to slouching over your desk wearing pajamas.
\6. ==Early in the conversation, ask the interviewer what she’s looking for.== Say something like, ==“I’ve read the position description, but I’d love to hear in your words what you’re looking for in this role.”== Though most phone interviewers have a list of questions they want to ask, they won’t be put off by this question.
\7. ==Don’t over-talk.== When you’re on the phone, it’s impossible to read the nonverbal cues that interviewers send in person, like averting their gaze or adjusting their posture as though they want to speak. Watch the clock and ==don’t talk for more than one minute at a stretch. Then pause and ask whether more detail would be useful.==
\8. Listen closely. Take notes of the questions the interviewer is asking. This can help you write a great thank-you note after you’re done.
\9. Ask about the next step in the process. Before signing off, say that you’re excited about the opportunity and ask what the next step in the process will be.
\10. Follow up. Treat the follow-up for a phone interview the same way you would an in-person interview. Email a thankyou note that refers to details in the interview. Include several concrete, specific ways you would contribute to the company if you got the job. Roy Cohen, a New York career coach who used to handle outplacement for Goldman Sachs and is the author of The Wall Street Professional’s Survival Guide, says that if you don’t get a response to your email, you should leave more than one phone message. You can say,” I want to make sure there wasn’t any information you need from me to move forward.” If it’s your second or third message, try, “I want to make sure everything is OK.” “I like to refer to this as the Jewish guilt approach,” says Cohen. Either you’re out of the running, in which case you have nothing to lose, or the interviewer has been busy and distracted, and will appreciate the reminder.
Guidance on doing a phone interview:
1.Treat the phone interview seriously, just as you would a face-to-face interview.
2.Have your resume and cover letter in front of you.
3.Make a cheat sheet.
4.Get a high-quality phone.
5.Shower, groom and dress up (at least a little).
6.Stand up, or at least sit up straight at a table or desk.
