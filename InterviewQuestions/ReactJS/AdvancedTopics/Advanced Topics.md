1. React Hooks: Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 and provide a way to use state and other React features without writing class components. Learn about commonly used hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer.
2. Context API: Context allows you to share data across components without passing props manually at each level. Learn how to create and consume context to manage global state in your React application.
3. React Router: React Router is a popular routing library for React applications. Learn how to set up routes, handle route parameters, and use nested routes to create a dynamic and navigable application.
4. Higher-Order Components (HOCs): HOCs are a way to reuse component logic. Learn how to create HOCs to enhance the functionality of your components, such as adding authentication, logging, or data fetching capabilities.
5. Render Props: Render props is another technique for code reuse in React. Learn how to use the render prop pattern to pass a function as a prop to a component, allowing it to render the UI based on that function's logic.
6. Error Boundaries: Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display a fallback UI instead. Learn how to create error boundaries to handle and recover from errors gracefully.
7. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): SSR allows you to render React components on the server, improving initial load times and SEO. Learn about libraries like Next.js or Gatsby.js that facilitate server-side rendering in React.
8. React Performance Optimization: As your application grows, optimizing performance becomes crucial. Learn about techniques like code splitting, memoization, virtualization, and performance profiling to ensure your React application runs smoothly.
9. React Testing: Testing is an essential part of building robust applications. Learn how to write unit tests and integration tests for React components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
10. React Patterns and Best Practices: Explore various patterns and best practices used in the React community, such as container/component pattern, presentational components, controlled components, and component composition.
