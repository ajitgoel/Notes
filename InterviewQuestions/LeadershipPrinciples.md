## ==Customer Obsession==

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

- Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult customer

- ==Tell me about a time you made something much simpler for customers==

  ​	==EOL-Next version: resident living together as hosuehold, single payment instead of multiple payments.== 

- ==Which company has the best customer service and why?==

  ​	==Costco: They treat their employees ethically and fairly. Their CEO earns a wage that is reasonable compared to the lowest workers.== 

- ==Tell me about a time you said no to a customer request and why==

  ​	==We get so many requests from Valued Holdings product and we have to constantly tell no to the users because of other higher priority items.== 

## ==Ownership==

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

- ==Tell me about a time you did something at work that wasn't your responsibility / in your job description==

  ​	==We had a water leak in our office, while we waited for the plumber to arrive, I got some spare clothes to stem the leak. The CEO of the company appreciated this response of mine.== 

- Describe an instance where you had to make an important decision without approval from your boss

- Tell me about a time you took ownership of a problem that was not the focus of your organization

- When was the last time that you sacrificed a long term value to complete a short term task?

## Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

- Tell me about a time you suggested a new approach
- What is the most innovative idea you've ever had?
- Tell me how you built a feature in an innovative way, give specific details

## Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

- Describe a time you made a mistake
- Tell me about a time you applied judgment to a decision when data was not available
- Tell me about a time you had very little information about a project but still had to move forward

## Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

- Explain something interesting you’ve learned recently
- Tell me about a time you taught yourself a skill
- Why Software Engineering?

## Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

- Describe a time you stepped in to help a struggling teammate
- Tell me about a time you helped boost your team morale
- Tell me about a time you hired or worked with people smarter than you are
- Why do you want to work at Amazon?

## Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

- Describe a project that you wish you had done better and how you would do it differently today
- Tell me about the most successful project you've done
- How do you ensure standards are met when delivering projects?

## Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

- Describe a time you proposed a non-intuitive solution to a problem and how you identified that it required a different way of thinking

  ​	==Application logging in all leasing applications which used an httpmodule approach and therefore did not require code changes in the application.== 

- Give a specific example where you drove adoption for your vision and explain how you knew it had been adopted by others

  ​	==Application logging in all leasing applications which used an httpmodule approach and therefore did not require code changes in the application.== 

- Tell me about your most significant accomplishment. Why was it significant?

## ==Bias for Action==

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

- ==Tell me about a time you had to change your approach because you were going to miss a deadline==

  ​	==In Realpage, we were going to miss a deadline to integrate with the payments team for payment declined scenarios, so we decided that we will provide a message to the user telling them to contact the leasing office directly to allow the user to be moved in.== 

- Tell me about a time you had to make a decision with incomplete information. How did you make it and what was the outcome?

- ==Tell me about a time when you launched a feature with known risks==

  ​	==In Pepsi project, we lauched a part of the application with incomplete features since that feature would be used later down in the workflow.== 

- ==Tell me about a time you broke a complex problem into simple sub-parts==

  ​	==in my work in Realpage, I used to create a truth table for different scenarios. This truth table would often be added into a business requirement document.== 

## Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

- Tell me about a time you successfully delivered a project without a budget or resources
- Describe the last time you figured out a way to keep an approach simple or to save on expenses

## Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

- ==How do you earn trust with a team?==

  ​	==pull them aside and get to know them better, especially wrt to their family.== 

- Tell me a piece of difficult feedback you received and how you handled it

- ==A co-worker constantly arrives late to a recurring meeting. What would you do?==

  ​	==pull him aside and check what the issue is. ask if the meeting needs to be rescheduled.== 

## Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

- Tell me about a project in which you had to deep dive into analysis
- Tell me about the most complex problem you have worked on
- Describe an instance when you used a lot of data in a short period of time

## ==Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit==

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

- ==Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker or manager and how you approached it==

  ​	==EOL: Next version when we hired a DBA for performance optimization and he did not do anything. Discussed with manager on how we need to proceed with this, constant disagreements with Jeff about application timelines== 

- ==Tell me about a time you disagreed with your team and convinced them to change their position==

  ​	==EOL: Next version-processing payments for a household as a single payment==

- ==Tell me about a time you had a conflict with your team but decided to go ahead with their proposal==

  ​	==EOL-Next version-Client side logging==

- ==Tell me about a time your work was criticized==

  ​	==EOL-Next version when we delivered 80% of functionality, the remaining team took more than 3 1/2 years to complete the remaining functionality.== 

## Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

- Tell me about the most challenging project you ever worked on
- How do you prioritize in your current role?
- What do you think are the most difficult parts of software engineering?

## Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

- Tell me about a time that you went above and beyond for an employee
- Tell me about a time you saw an issue that would negatively impact your team. How did you deal with it?
- How do you manage a low performer in the team? How do you identify a good performer in the team and help in their career growth?

## Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.

- ==Give me an example on when you made a decision which impacted the team or the company==

  ​	==Application logging in all leasing applications.== 

- ==Can you tell me a decision that you made about your work and you regret now?==

  ​	==not telling EOL-Next version VP that estimates were way off.==
