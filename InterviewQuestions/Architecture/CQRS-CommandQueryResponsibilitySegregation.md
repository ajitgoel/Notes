Starting with CQRS, CQRS is simply the creation of two objects where there was previously only one The separation occurs based upon whether the methods are a command or a query (the same definition that is used by Meyer in ==**Command and Query Separation**, a command is any method that mutates state and a query is any method that returns a value==). When most people talk about CQRS they are really speaking about applying the CQRS pattern to the object that represents the service boundary of the application. Consider the following pseudo-code service definition.
**CustomerService**
void MakeCustomerPreferred(CustomerId)
Customer GetCustomer(CustomerId)
CustomerSet GetCustomersWithName(Name)
CustomerSet GetPreferredCustomers()
void ChangeCustomerLocale(CustomerId, NewLocale)
void CreateCustomer(Customer)
void EditCustomerDetails(CustomerDetails)
Applying CQRS on this would result in two services
**CustomerWriteService**
void MakeCustomerPreferred(CustomerId)
void ChangeCustomerLocale(CustomerId, NewLocale)
void CreateCustomer(Customer)
void EditCustomerDetails(CustomerDetails)
**CustomerReadService**
Customer GetCustomer(CustomerId)
CustomerSet GetCustomersWithName(Name)
CustomerSet GetPreferredCustomers()

This separation however enables us to do many interesting things architecturally, the largest is that ==it forces a break of the mental retardation that because the two use the same data they should also use the same data model.== The largest possible benefit though is that it recognizes that their are different architectural properties when dealing with commands and queries â€¦ for example ==it allows us to host the two services differently eg: we can host the read service on 25 servers and the write service on two.== The processing of commands and queries is fundamentally asymmetrical, and scaling the services symmetrically does not make a lot of sense.
