## Â Type casting
Implicit casting is done automatically by Java (converting a smaller type to a larger type size): byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double Explicit casting should be done manually (converting a larger type to a smaller size type): double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
Remember 1 casting rule, implicit casting only work for larger type direction-->-->-->--> When you're trying to insert big into small, you need to do explicit casting<--(explicit)<--

Q: Select all lines where explicit casting is required.
long lo = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // (1)
==int i = lo; // (2)
char ch = i; // (3)==
double d = ch; // (4)
==float f = d; // (5)==

The combination of the name of the method and the list of its parameters is known as a method signature.

Q: Given a variableÂ **str**Â of the typeÂ **String**.
Â Select one or more options from the list
==**str.substring(0, 5)**Â returns a substring from 0 to 4 indexes (inclusive) of the string.==
**str[n]**Â returns a character that has the index n.
**str.get(n)**Â returns a character that has the index n.
**str.substring(0, 3)**Â returns a substring from 0 to 3 indexes (inclusive) of the string.
==**str.charAt(n)**Â returns a character that has the index n.==

## Arrays as parameters
##### Varargs and other parameters
If a method has more than one parameter, theÂ `vararg`Â parameter must be the last one in the declaration of the method.

Q: You are given a method with the following declaration:
public static int method(int[] array, int... vararg) { return 1; }
Select all correct ways to invoke this method.
 ==method(new int[] { 1, 2, 3 });
method(new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }, 4, 5);==

final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); // 1
final int a;                                    // 2
==final int b = scanner.nextInt() + a;            // 3==
final int c = 0;                                // 4
==c = b;                                          // 5==

        return age;
    }
    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
class Pet extends Animal {
    protected String name;
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
class Cat extends Pet {    
    protected String color;
    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }
    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }
}
```


Given the following object:

```java
Pet cat = new Cat();
```

Select all **invalid** method invocations.

    int age;
    double height;
}
```

After you execute the following code,

```java
Tree tree1 =  new Tree();
Tree tree2 = tree1;
Tree tree3 = tree2;
tree1 = new Tree();
tree1.age = 5;
tree2.age = 10;

    static void staticMethod() { }    
    void method();    
    default void defaultMethod() { }
    abstract void abstractMethod();
}
class B implements A { }
```

Which methods must be implemented in the class `B`?
==Spot ðŸŽ¯ the curly braces. (Where there's none, implementation is required)==
==in the class that implements the interface, all methods that do not have an implementation in the interface must be implemented.==

defaultMethod

staticMethod

==abstractMethod==

## Multiple constructors

##### Suppose, you have a class

Imagine you have a class with two constructors. You'd like to invoke the first constructor from the second one. Where should you place the statement `this(...)`? Select the most suitable option.
==https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1168345/why-do-this-and-super-have-to-be-the-first-statement-in-a-constructor==
==we need super() to be first to ensure that the object is fully constructed (has reached Object class constructor).==

It must be the first statement in the body of the first constructor.
It must be the last statement in the body of the second constructor.
It can be placed anywhere in the body of the first constructor.
It must be the last statement in the body of the first constructor.
==It must be the first statement in the body of the second constructor.==
It can be placed anywhere in the body of the second constructor.



## The keyword super

##### When the keyword cannot be used

Given the following class hierarchy, select all **illegal** usages of the keyword `super`:

```java
class A {
    protected int a;
}
class B extends A {
    protected int b;   
    public B(int a, int b) {
        super();     // 1
        super.a = a; // 2
        super.b = b; // 3
    }
}
class C extends B {
    protected int c;
    public C(int a, int b) {
        super(a); // 4
    }

## Annotations basics

##### Rules of annotations

What are the rules of marking an element with an annotation in Java? Select all correct options. Select one or more options from the list
All annotations can mark classes and methods.
==It's possible to mix built-in and external annotations in a **.java** file.==
==Some annotations can mark classes, methods, fields, and variables.==
A class can be marked with no more than one annotation.
All annotations include elements.

##### Create by

An external annotation **`@CreatedBy`** has one string element named **`name`**. The element does not have a default value. How can you mark a field using this annotation? Select all correct options.

==the element can only be omitted if its name is "value", otherwise, you have to inform the name of the element.==

 Select one or more options from the list

@CreatedBy("John Coder")
==@CreatedBy(name = "Unknown")==
@CreatedBy(value = "John Coder")
@CreatedBy
==@CreatedBy(name = "John Coder")==

##### Deprecated annotation

 Select one or more options from the list

==@Deprecated==

@Deprecated(since = "8", forRemoval = "unknown")

@Deprecated(since = 11, forRemoval = true)

==@Deprecated(since = "1.0")==

==@Deprecated(since = "5.3", forRemoval = true)==

==To be able to make changes independently to the frontend and backend logic.==

==We need a server to store and structure data.==

To always get up-to-date answers from **the client**.

## Immutability

##### Cat in a box

Imagine, you have a box of objects called `my_favorite_box`. The type of the items in the box is not predetermined and at the moment this is a box of kittens.

The object `my_favorite_box` is considered **==immutable==** (but variable reassigning is **allowed**).

What can you do with the object `my_favorite_box`? Choose all that apply.

Add another kitten to the box

Add a puppy to the box

==Get a box of puppies and say that now this box is `my_favorite_box`==

==Look at the kittens that are in the box==

## Introduction to generic programming

##### Pastry packing optimization

You were asked to help with Java programming for a pie company. At the moment, they bake pies, cakes, and tarts and pack them in nice boxes to sell. Unfortunately, their approach to box programming is quite outdated and each pie type requires its own box class. This approach is poorly scalable and will turn the situation into a nightmare with product range growth (imagine all these: ApplePieBox, StrawberryPieBox, etc.).

To avoid this, implement a universal Box class that will accommodate anything with *put* methods and give it back with *get* methods.

/**

  Box for cakes

*/

class CakeBox {

  private Cake cake;

  public void put(Cake cake) {

â€‹    this.cake = cake;

  }

  public Cake get() {

â€‹    return this.cake;

  }

}

/**

  Box for pies

*/

class PieBox {

  private Pie pie;

  public void put(Pie pie) {

â€‹    this.pie = pie;

  }

  public Pie get() {

â€‹    return this.pie;

  }

}

/**

  Box for tarts

*/

class TartBox {

  private Tart tart;

  public void put(Tart tart) {

â€‹    this.tart = tart;

  }

  public Tart get() {

â€‹    return this.tart;

  }

}

==class Box<T> {==

  ==private T t;==

  ==public void put(T t) {==

â€‹    ==this.t = t;==

  ==}==

  ==public T get() {==

â€‹    ==return this.t;==

  ==}==

==}==

class Cake { }

class Pie { }

class Tart { }

##### Generic parameter values

Consider a generic class:

```java
public class Example<T> { /* large body */ }
```

What can be used as X when creating instances?

```java
Example<X> example = new Example<>()
```

==Character==

42

==String==

"JetBrains"

char

## Generics and Object

##### Instance without type argument

Consider the following generic class:

```java
class MyClass<T> {

    private T t;

    public MyClass(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}
```

What will the `get` method return if you create an instance but don't specify the type argument?

```java
MyClass instance = new MyClass("Hello!");
```

An exception occurs after executing this line

==It will return an **Object**==

It will return **Void**

It does not compile

It will return a **String**

## Lambda expressions

A lambda expression always has parameters.

==If a lambda expression has only one argument, parentheses () are not mandatory.==

A lambda expression should always return a value.

==A lambda expression can contain multiple statements within the body.==

##### Expressions

Select all valid lambda expressions.

==there are 3 answer, don't forger  if it has one argument, () is not mandatory  and if it has more than one argument, () become mandatory==

x := x

x => x

(x, y) => x + y

x, y -> x + y

==(z) -> z==

==x -> x==

==(x, y) -> x + y==

1)

```java
final int a = 3;
Function<Integer, Integer> f = (x) -> a * x;
a++;
```

{  
  persons: [  
    {  
      "firstName": "Stanislaw",
      "lastName": "Lem",

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Write the line number as the answer.

If you try your best but you don't succeed, you can search the JSON validators â€” special services that check the correctness of the code.

Implement a method that takes three objects (instances of `Thread` or its subclasses). The method must start passed objects as threads in a way that the order of their execution goes like this: **t3, t2, t1**. These threads print secret phrases to the standard output, their output must always be the same.

All given threads must be terminated before the implemented method is completed.

Otherwise, the testing system will give you some hints on throwing exceptions in the main thread, for example:

```java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: All threads must be terminated before ending the implemented method
```

 class Invoker {

  public static void invokeMethods(Thread t1, Thread t2, Thread t3) throws InterruptedException {

â€‹    t3.start();

â€‹    t3.join();

â€‹    t2.start();

â€‹    t2.join();

â€‹    t1.start();

â€‹    t1.join();

  }

}

## Exceptions in threads

##### MyThread class

There's a class **MyThread** that extends **Thread**.

We create and start an instance of the class in the current thread:

```java
Thread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();

// here is a lot of code with exceptions

thread.join();
```

==If an uncaught exception occurs in **thread**, the current thread will be stopped==

If an uncaught exception occurs in **thread**, the current thread won't be stopped

==If an uncaught exception occurs in the current thread, **thread** will be stopped==

If an uncaught exception occurs in the current thread, **thread** won't be stopped

## Shared data

##### Select all atomic

Select all atomic operations.
==The volatile keyword allows us to make visible changes of a field made by one thread to other threads. This keyword also makes writing to double and long fields atomic. But the keyword doesn't make the increment/decrement and similar operations atomic.==

==value = 5; // where value is int field==

value++; // where value is volatile int field

==value = 500L; // where value is volatile long field==

value = 5L; // where value is long field

value = 5.0d; // where value is double field

## Thread synchronization

##### Multithreaded counter

Here's a class named `Counter`. The class has a single field `count`. An instance of the class is accessed by different threads concurrently. Each thread invokes the method `inc` to increment the field many times.

After the completion of all threads, this field has an incorrect value.

Fix the code, so that it can work correctly with multiple threads. Do not make the class public.

**Example:**

Let's assume we have one instance of `Counter` and two threads. Each thread invokes the method `inc` 5000000 times. If everything works correctly after the completion of both threads `count` must be 10000000.

class Counter {
  int count = 0;
  public ==synchronized== void inc() {
    count++;
  }
}

## Collections and thread-safety

##### ConcurrentModificationException cases

What collections may produce `ConcurrentModificationException`?
==You can seek for the line "throw new ConcurrentModificationException()" in: - non-thread-safe collection ArrayList, - in totally synchronized Vector, - and even in thread-safe CopyOnWriteArrayList and you'll find it in all three cases.==

totally synchronized

none

non thread-safe

##### Hashing example

Which of the following functions can be considered a hash function?

A function that receives a text and removes all spaces from it

==A function that receives an address and returns its post code==

==A function that receives a number and returns its first digit==

## Hash function

##### Hashing an array

Consider the following hash function for an array of integers:

- if the array has at least 5 elements, pick 5 of them at random and return their sum as their hash value
- if there are fewer than 5, return the sum of all elements.

Select all the reasons why this is not a good hash function:

It is too slow

==The same array can have different hash values==

==Does not take all the values in the array into consideration==

==For arrays of up to 5 values, the hash value is the same no matter the order of the values==

## Hash table

##### Let it resize!

You have a hash table with 10 buckets, 6 elements, and a max load factor 0.75. What is the minimum number of elements you have to insert to make the hash table resize?
i.e ==What is the minimum number of elements you have to ADD to existing 6 elements to make the hash table resize==

## The Map interface

##### Creating a map

 Create `TreeMap` named `map` and fill it with the following three key-value pairs:

```java
Omega - 24
Alpha - 1
Gamma - 3
```

where strings are keys and numbers are values.

The code for displaying the map is already written.

 Report a typo

**Sample Input 1:**

```

```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
{Alpha=1, Gamma=3, Omega=24}
```

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {   

â€‹    SortedMap<String, Integer> map=new TreeMap<>();

â€‹    map.put("Omega", 24);

â€‹    map.put("Alpha", 1);

â€‹    map.put("Gamma", 3);

â€‹    System.out.println(map);

  }

}

## YAML

##### Map mistake

This is a YAML map with personal information but it has two syntax mistakes. What are these mistakes?

```yaml
personal_information: name = Anna, age = 23, occupation = programmer
```

there should be semicolons instead of commas

==key-value pairs should be each on its line==

there are no opening and closing tags

==The key and value in each pair should be separated by colons==

## Basic project structure

##### Google annotations

In this challenge, you will apply your skill to google information about the Spring Framework.

There is an annotation called `@SpringBootApplication`. Select a combination of annotations which can replace it to provide the same abilities to your application.

It is not required to understand these annotations clearly to complete this challenge.

==@EnableAutoConfiguration==

@Autowired

==@ComponentScan==

@Controller

## Introduction to Spring Web MVC

##### Access URL

The server is running on port `9090`.

Select all the correct ways to access an `index.html` file.

==http://localhost:9090==

http://localhost:8080

==http://localhost:9090/==

http://localhost:8080/index.html

==http://localhost:9090/index.html==

## Posting and deleting data via REST

##### Complete the handler description

 Choose the missing parts of the method described below:

```java
@PostMapping("/products/{id}")
public void addProduct({1} int id, {2} String description) {
    productMap.add(id, description);
}
```

==1 - @PathVariable; 2 - @RequestParam==

1 - @RequestParam; 2 - @PathVariable

1 - @RequestParam; 2 - @RequestParam

1 - @PathVariable; 2 - @PathVariable

## Handling requests with bodies

##### Find the correct mapping class

Here is the JSON :

```json
{
  "id" : "1112hjkh3481soa7",
  "destination" : "London",
  "seat" : 143,
  "withLunch" : true
}
```

Choose the correct mapping class of the following:

1

```java
public class TicketInfo {

    public String id;
    public String destination;
    public int seat;
    public boolean withLunch;

    TicketInfo() {}

    //setters and getters
}
```

```java
public class TicketInfo {

    public String id;
    public String destination;
    public int seat;
    public boolean lunchEnabled;

    TicketInfo() {}

    //setters
}
```
