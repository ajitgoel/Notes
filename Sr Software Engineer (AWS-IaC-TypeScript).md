Nintendo is an equal opportunity employer. We offer a welcoming and inclusive environment in service to one another, our products, the diverse consumers we represent, and the communities we call home. We do all of this with kindness, empathy and respect for each other.

Sadly, great games don't grow on trees... but they do come out of Nintendo's global product publishing pipeline! In this role you will join the team of engineers building and maintaining the systems used to get games into the hands of gamers. From the web portal developers use to describe products, to tracking a game's certification, to ordering and printing game cartridges, our software powers every step of the process. We use a microservices architecture and are constantly evolving our technology to keep pace with the business and industry. You will use tools like AWS CDK, Kubernetes, and the Atlassian suite to practice DevOps to keep shipping new features and improvements to our users.

At Nintendo, we value the pursuit of excellence. And we strive to apply that to our internal software systems too. Even if only one person carries a pager, we all work to ensure it stays silent. If this sounds interesting to you, let's talk more!
