Now, instead of redeploying a virtual network, just going through the same steps again, I'm going
to test myself here.
I'm going to basically get the arm template, modify the values of it, and then we're going to deploy
that to get our second Venette.
So we already have Venette one.
I'm going to create VEDAT two.
It's going to be in the same location, in the same resource group.
Vignettes do require their own IP address range.
And so we're going to go from ten point one to ten point to the subnet as well.
Needs to go up from ten point one to ten point two.
I'm going to now save the parameters.
We can see that all of these things have gotten filled in, it looks like appropriately.
Now, I'm going to it shouldn't cost me anything, virtual networks don't cost anything.
I'm going to deploy the second Venette to this resource group.
So let's say some deployment succeeded.
Usually takes a second here.
Now, we do see that there are two deployments that succeeded.
We can see that two got deployed.
And there it is, Venette, one in Venette, two are both deployed, one traditional way, one as a
armed template modification.
