Now this question has come up before where people would like to connect their two branch offices to
each other using Azure once they find out that you can set up a site to site VPN or an express route
VPN.
They wonder if they can do interoffice connectivity through Azure.
The answer is actually yes.
Microsoft provides this virtual one service which allows you to connect to and points to each other
if I flip over to the documentation we can see here that it's only 25 cents an hour in order to have
the hub running within Azure itself and then you're going to pay for connecting a site to site VPN or
a point to site VPN or an express route into that hub.
So if you've got a Toronto office a New York office and a London office and one of them we're joining
unexpressed wrote and two of them are running on site to site VPN ends.
Then you're adding an additional 15 cents an hour on top of that 25 cents.
So it's a very affordable way for you to connect your offices as long as they're connected into Azure.
