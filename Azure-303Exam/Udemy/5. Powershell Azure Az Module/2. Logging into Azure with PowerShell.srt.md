Now before we can do anything with Azure and power show we need to log in now the command for logging
in is called Connect a Z account.
Now when we run this command it's going to actually force us to go into a web browser.
Do the log in and then come back to this so you can see here.
I see connect AC account.
It says go to this web browser and enter this code.
So I'm actually going to copy this and open it up into a web browser
and you can see it's asking for the code.
And so I'm going to copy the code here
now it's going to have me log into my Azure account.
So of course it's going to be different for you.
Now I am already logged in in a different tab.
And so it recognizes me.
And when I close this window you can see that I'm logged in so the first commands you need to know for
power Shell is connect dash A-Z account and that is required before we can do anything else against
our Azure subscription.
