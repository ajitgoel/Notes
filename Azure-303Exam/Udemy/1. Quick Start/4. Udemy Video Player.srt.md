So before we get into the content, I just want to take a minute here to talk about the YouTube video
player in the bottom left of the screen is the speed control.
And if you think I'm talking too fast or talking too slow, you can change the speed of that down in
the left.
On the right is the captions.
And if you want to see the text of what I'm seeing at the bottom of the video, you can choose either
the English language captions or in another language.
If you want to see a transcript, there's also a transcript button.
And so you can see on the side of the screen the script of this video.
Finally, reviews are the lifeblood of this course.
So if you do choose to leave a review, I would be so grateful this will help other students to find
this course in search.
If you're not ready to leave a review, you can click the ask me later button or ask me at the end of
the course.
Both options are available to you.
But if you are willing to leave a review, thank you so much for that.
I really do appreciate it.
Thanks for being a student.
If there's something that I can do to make your experience better, please let me know in the Q&amp;A section
of the course.
Thank you.
