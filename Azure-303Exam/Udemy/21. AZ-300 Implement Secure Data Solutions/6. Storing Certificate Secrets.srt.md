So we said within the key vault you can store secrets and you can store keys keys in this case are x
5 0 9 certificates.
Here's a diagram taken from Microsoft that shows that the key vault is accessible using an API the thing
with keys.
Are there a little there a little complex in that it contains the secret part of the key the public
part of the key and metadata around the key.
You know when it's expired and for what domain it's good for and etc. etc. So keys are a little more
complex than just text fields.
Now there is a way to set up as your key vault to interact directly with certain cert authorities.
So if you basically go into key vault and you set it up to work with your kith your certificate authority
then it can create keys itself using your certificate authority then it can renew keys and let's say
keys are going to expire it automatically goes and cake creates a new version of a key with a longer
expiry date etc..
So that is one option or you can be the middleman between the Azure key vault and the certificate authority
of your choice.
So that's a more broader range of certificate authorities instead of being restricted to only the ones
that Microsoft supports.
But it does require manual work on your on your part to create keys and upload them.
So with your integration of key vault you can do auto renewal with your with a certificate authority.
