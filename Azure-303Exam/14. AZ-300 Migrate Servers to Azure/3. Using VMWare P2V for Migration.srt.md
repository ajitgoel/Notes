So we should mention that there is another alternative to migrating to Azure for VMware.
So we talked about how as you migrate allows you to assess your environment and you use Azure Site Recovery
to connect to your v sphere server and basically start that migration process into Microsoft Azure but
VM where also provides its own P to v tool which is also called V sensor converter and V sensor converter
basically allows you to export your virtual machines that run in VMware into Microsoft Virtual Machine
formats and so VM where also provides a tool to do this migration besides the Azure site recovery tool.
So both companies want to allow you to continue to use your VM where machines into Microsoft Azure.
