So I want to keep playing with the Azure Active Directory features but to do that I think I want to
get up to the Azure premium p 2 level.
So I'm going to go into my Azure Active Directory.
This is a test account that I can play with and eventually delete when I no longer need.
And I'm going to basically start the free trial so because I want the identity protection I want to
start the premium P to retrial so the trial includes 100 licenses it will be active for 30 days if I
wish to upgrade I'll need to purchase.
Ok so I'm going to say activate so we're going to let this activate so successfully activated then coming
up against start playing with the premium P2 features.
