So let's say that you have a user who their phone is dead or they lost their phone and they need to
be able to log in to do their work.
But they don't have the third factor the multi factor authentication.
Look is there anything that you can do for them.
Well there is a setting called one time bypass so it would go down to here.
We can basically say one of these users will get three hundred seconds which is a five minute period
of time where they can log in using their user I.D. and password without performing the multi factor
authentication.
So if I go in here it says three hundred seconds I can look for
John John Doe re-enter seconds give it a reason he lost his phone
and now user John Doe has is being allowed to log in for the next 300 seconds it goes into effect immediately
and expires in five minutes or he can log in.
And even though multi factor authentication is turned on it allowed him to get past that step just for
a limited period of time.
So this is another way another way that your support staff can help users who are struggling with their
multi Patrick implication.
