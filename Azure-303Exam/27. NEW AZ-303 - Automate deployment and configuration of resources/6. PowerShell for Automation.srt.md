Now, we've been talking a lot about armed templates, but obviously armed police is not the only way
to deploy resources in Azure.
We mentioned that Power Shell and Seelie allow you to manipulate the Azure APIs directly.
So here's a GitHub repository under the Azure account called Azure Docs Power SQL Samples.
And we can go in here and pick let's pick Cosmo's DB and look at one of these common ones.
And so we can basically do a partial script that just does an update to the Azure Kosmos account based
on inputs passed into the script.
So you can just do manipulation and automation without using our templates at all.
It's not required it, but our templates are the, I would say, recommended path.
You're not going to see a lot of examples on the exam of manipulating the Azure account directly using
power.
But that might be something that if you want to, for your work, develop a library of scripts that
could be useful.
So as your docs powerful samples repository has, you know, lots of examples, there's over 500 commits.
And so we can see a couple of dozen examples of powerful scripts for working with Azure.
Now, CLIA is going to be some of the similar.
If so, if you're a Linux person and you're working within the partial Seelie, there's going to be
ways of manipulating Azure within Seelie as well.
And so you can go ahead and create your own scripts in that way.
