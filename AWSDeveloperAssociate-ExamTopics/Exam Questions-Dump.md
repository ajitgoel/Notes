`hot` shard is resharded.

==Question #85 Topic 1==
A developer at a company recently created a serverless application to process and show data from business reports. The application's user interface (UI) allows users to select and start processing the flies. The UI displays a message when the result is available to view. The application uses AWS Step Functions with AWS Lambda functions to process the files. The developer used Amazon API Gateway and Lambda functions to create an API to support the UI.
