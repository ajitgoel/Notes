Hi, 
My name is Ajit Goel and I am the production manager for Shirtlogue, I need your help with the following. 
We would like to sell TShirts but we need the best possible price and MOQ information. Link for Raglan Tshirt and TShirt size chart is: <https://imgur.com/a/l72RIot>. 
Initial order will be for 10000 tshirts(5000 Plain Tshirts, 5000 Raglan TShirts), Weight of the fabric will be 205 grams or above. 
When we ship the order we will need to have a mix of all the sizes and colors(for each of 5000 Plain Tshirts, 5000 Raglan TShirts). If creating different color raglan tshirts for a 5000 Raglan TShirt order will not work based on the order size then please advise.

We would need quote of 10000 tshirts-500 Tshirts each for the following

White TShirt(500 Tshirts each for the following-Total 5000 Tshirts):
1. 6M, 12M, 18M, 2T, 3T, 4T, 5T, 6T for Infant and Toddler(unisex) 
2. XS, S for Youth(unisex)

White/ Black Raglan TShirt(500 Tshirts each for the following-Total 5000 Tshirts):

2. XS, S, M, L, XL for Youth(unisex)

Weight of the fabric will be 180 grams or above.

Are you an agent, manufacturer, supplier, or trading company? I need you to advise best possible price and also give me at least three other options of similar items that you have so that I can review them with my boss. Any qualities you can send us to pick from would also be helpful. Please send us quality standards. Also its company policy that we don’t pay for samples so I need to make sure you are able to provide me with samples. We need to check the quality of the product and make sure we are happy with the sample before we place an order. We are really looking to build stronger partnerships with new factories / and or agents.
