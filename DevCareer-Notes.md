- [How I 5x'd My Rate In Three Years (graph included)](https://devcareer.elliotbonneville.com/75d18802eaaa487dbd510a34f7d4691e) (read for free now!)

- - Stumbled into web development fairly young and was very unsophisticated
  - Took the first job I was offered, and stayed there for three years
  - When I finally quit that first job, my rate skyrocketed
  - Now I make 4.7x what I made three years ago
  - Some might argue that this isn't a lot, but it's by choice
  - I didn't start at Google or have a degree in computer science
  - I didn't move to Silicon Valley — I live in Rhode Island, near my family and in-laws
  - I work remotely, when and where I feel like working
  - And the best part? It had nothing to do with luck and everything to do with tactics

- **Change jobs at least once a year**

- - It's impossible to sell what isn't for sale, so you should always be available for hire
  - Company loyalty is no longer a valid concept (if it ever was)
  - ==Moving around frequently expands your network quickly, and a network is crucial==
  - ==It works better for contractors / consultants more than for full-time engineers== — more on this later

- **In the early stages, find work by talking with recruiters**

- - People often refuse to talk to recruiters — don't throw away a resource

  - Post your resume online, or reach out manually to recruiters if you can't

  - - Don't give references if you're in a sensitive situation with your current job!

  - Be aware of recruiters' priorities and how they relate to your priorities

  - - Recruiter needs to get people hired at the lowest rate possible, as quickly as possible
    - Depending on the quality of the recruiting agency, these numbers may vary
    - Need to avoid passing incompetent people to their clients, as this will make them appear so

  - Learn sales and bargaining to negotiate confidently with recruiters and hiring managers

  - Be prepared to be negotiated down from your initial rate — "giving face"

  - Don't cave too far on the rate you quote a recruiter, they are very good at getting you to do so and talk to people all day doing this

  - Keep your finger on the pulse of the market (and your own value) by collecting information from recruiters — always pushing a higher rate

  - ==Everything you say to a recruiter can and will be used against you==

  - - Confidence is critical
    - So is being rehearsed
    - ==Practice, practice, practice — talk to every recruiter who reaches out to you==

  - There are many companies with no HR department who rely on contractors for everything, including hiring other contractors

- **Learn and use sales tactics to sell yourself**

- - Doesn't mean being a sleazy car salesman
  - ==You must get comfortable with speaking to people on the phone==
  - ==Paint a consistent, compelling, and true story about your history, skillset, and motivations==
  - ==Pick a niche and own it==

- **Leverage scarcity when negotiating for a new role**

- - When ready to look for work, NEVER accept the first offer
  - Rather, wait until you have two or three offers lined up at the same time
  - Creates a reality (as opposed to an illusion) of scarcity
  - Multiple recruiters' / companies' offers playing off each other
  - The more you are wanted, the more you are wanted
  - Can significantly increase your rates (potentially even double)

- [Don't Work With Startups (Or FAANGs)](https://devcareer.elliotbonneville.com/d01ec856bcef4b6888a19c57bd3bbd16) (read for free now)

- - Don't work at a startup — startups optimize to get as much done as quickly as possible and with as little money as possible

  - Corporations optimize to prevent making mistakes, and are willing to spend both time and money to avoid them

  - However, FAANGs often have stringent requirements like location, and/or can be hard to get into

  - High salary comes with living and working in a high COL, which offsets the value

  - Less autonomy and freedom comes with more responsibility with the higher rates working full-time at a FAANG

  - There is also more competition because FAANGs are "cooler"

  - Contract with mid-size corporations who need talent

  - They also still have growing pains where you can be of true value

  - Live in a low COL area, charge in a high COL area

  - I live in Rhode Island, and charge Boston / New York rates

  - Georgia / North Carolina are hot right now (doesn't only have to be tech hubs)

  - You should probably be working remotely

  - - Not true for everybody, of course
    - Prioritize working asynchronously like many of the best clients and smartest developers

[Don't Work With Startups (Or FAANGs)](https://devcareer.elliotbonneville.com/no-startups-or-faangs)

- **==Start your own company, only take contracts, and pay yourself benefits==**

- - Bill corp-to-corp — cuts fluff out of the cash comp (no, I don't care about ping-pong and free beer)
  - Mark up an extra 17% to 25%
  - Pay for your own health insurance
  - Leverage your parents' health insurance if you can
  - Get business insurance and a business bank account
  - Read your contracts and be prepared and able to negotiate where necessary
  - Most of the time — the vast majority of the time — you don't need a lawyer
  - Know what the norms are and how contracts are structured

- **Keep your resume optimized to generate job offers**

- - Keep your resume under two pages
  - List past experience that points to the story you're currently telling
  - Don't list your real age and don't list your oldest experience — ageism
  - [...more resume advice, sharing my resume]

- **Optimize your LinkedIn profile to attract recruiters**

- - Collect LinkedIn reviews
  - Consolidate your contracts under one company
  - Turn on the #openforwork option
  - Connect with lots of people (at minimum 500)
  - [...more LI advice, sharing my LI]

- **Value your network, but don't rely on it (yet)**

- - When composed of past clients, your network has a value / rate threshold that is largely static
  - You should be constantly increasing your rate, while your past contacts expect you to continue to work for a lower rate
  - If you continue to rely on past clients for work, you will freeze your rate climb
  - Still, your network is your ticket out of working with recruiters, so your network should grow with you
  - Eventually it will sustain you but right now it is still too small, especially if you have been in one role for a long time
  - Find a mentor. Mentors don't just make a quantitative difference, they make a qualitative difference

- **You, personally, should be charging more**

- - Read Patrick McKenzie on "you should charge more".
  - So many people under charge for their work that you are almost certainly part of that group
  - Information arbitrage — companies directly profit from software developers not knowing how much they're worth
  - Push your rates to see how much you can get away with

## Extras

- Be careful not to burn any bridges. You never know who you'll run into later down the line.

- Avoid local maxima WRT rates both geographically, in terms of your network, and in terms of your tech stack

- - Take one step back to take two steps forward if you have to

- What you get done is more important than how long you work

- - How focused are you
  - Deep focus
  - Used to be pedantic about time down to minutes and skipped a lot of fun stuff while simultaneously being totally unproductive and stressed
  - Learned about "Deep Work" (ala Cal Newport) and immediately destressed + became much more productive, AND had more fun

- Don't be afraid to quit a job early

- If you are in a manager role or non-tech role, find a way to keep your hands dirty. Write code. This is CRITICAL.

- Standing up for yourself at your job (how to improve your work experience)
