## [5. How to pass data between components?](https://mokkapps.de/blog/my-top-react-interview-questions#5-how-to-pass-data-between-components)

==1.  Use props to pass data from parent to child.==
2.  Use callbacks to pass data from child to parent.
3.  Use any of the following methods to pass data among siblings:
    -   Integrating the methods mentioned above.
    ==-   Using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).==
    -   Utilizing [React's Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#api).

**5. What is the significance of refs in React?**

==Similarly to keys, refs are added as an attribute to a `React.createElement()` call, such as `<li ref="someName"/>`. The `ref` serves a different purpose, it provides us quick and simple access to the DOM Element represented by a React Element.==

10. What are the most common approaches for styling a React application?
### CSS Classes
React allows class names to be specified for a component, like class names are specified for a DOM element in HTML.
When developers first start using React after developing traditional web applications, they often use CSS classes for styling because they are already familiar with the approach.
### Inline CSS
Styling React elements using inline CSS allows styles to be completely scoped to an element using a well-understood, standard approach. However, there are certain styling features that are not available with inline styles. For example, the styling of `:hover` pseudo-classes.
### Pre-processors Such as Sass, Stylus, and Less
Pre-processors are often used on React projects. This is because, like CSS, they are well understood by developers and are often already in use if React is being integrated into a legacy application.

### CSS-in-JS Modules Such as Styled Components, Emotion, and Styled-jsx
