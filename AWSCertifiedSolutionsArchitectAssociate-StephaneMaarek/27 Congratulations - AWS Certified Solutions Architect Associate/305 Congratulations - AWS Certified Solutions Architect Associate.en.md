<v Instructor>Okay, so congratulations</v>
on passing this course.
You finished it and this is amazing.
I really hope that you will pass the exam
without a hitch but I'm sure you will.
And if you haven't done so yet,
I would love a review from you.
They really help new students make the right decision
when it comes to choosing a course on the AWS.
If you passed, please let me know.
I'd be more than happy that I've helped in some way,
so post it in the Q and A to help
and motivate other students, share your tips
that you are to prepare for
and post it on LinkedIn and tag me.
I will also be really happy
to congratulate you directly there.
I hope that you learned a lot on
how to use AWS in this course.
That's really what I want you to have in the end.
It's not about the certification.
It's about you learning a lot
and becoming a tremendously good AWS Solutions Architect,
so I hope that I've helped you achieve that dream
or that goal and I hope to see you
in another course of mine.
All right, good luck for the exam.
