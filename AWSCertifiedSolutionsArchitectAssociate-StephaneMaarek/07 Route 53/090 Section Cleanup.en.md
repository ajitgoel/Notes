<v Instructor>Okay, so to clean up this section,</v>
you could go ahead and delete all the records
from there that you wanted,
so you could click on all of this, for example,
I'll just do it for all of them.
And then once you have selected all of them
that you're ready for,
you go and click on Delete Record Set.
So this is just an example,
so I'll click on Delete Record Set
and click on Confirm,
and you basically do this for all the record set
that you wanna delete.
Then, if you remember,
we've created a few things,
so we've created an EC2 instance in three different regions,
so I'll terminate all my EC2 instance, so Ireland,
there was North Virginia,
and there was also Tokyo.
So let's go right here, North Virginia.
I right click and terminate this one.
Yup, going on,
and then Tokyo,
I right click and terminate this one.
Excellent.
And then if I go back to Ireland
and I go to load balancers,
I also delete my load balancer from there.
Excellent.
And that's it.
That's how you just clean up everything we've created,
and you can also delete all these leftover records,
so here we go.
This way they're all clean.
And that's it.
You're ready to move on to the next lectures.
All right, see you in the next lecture.
