So the first thing we're going to do is sign up to AWS
So we'll just go on google.com and type AWS sign up just get one of the first links and we arrive
on to create an account page.
Now as you can see each AWS account includes 12 months of free tier access.
I encourage you to visit this link to understand exactly what's in the free tier.
So if you look at it we can see that we have a free tier accounts right away and so there's some stuff
there is 12 months free and some stuff that's always free so we can click on twelve months free and see
exactly which services are free for how long.
And always free as well to see which ones are always free for AWS
Basically this free tier allows us to learn AWS without spending a dime.
Now that is a chance that you'll spend a little bit of money with me I would suggest you make it 10
to 20 dollar budget for this course.
I will tell you any time you might spend money if you do not want to spend money just do not do the
tutorial with me and watched the video you'll be fine.
But most of the tutorial is going to be done on the free tier.
Now for the console.
You just sign up.
You enter your e-mail address your password and AWS account name.
Now after doing this you'll have to provide contact information.
So you may be a professional or personal account.
You can just choose that you get personal accounts and you put your phone number your region your address
your city and so on when you're there you have to enter your credit card number expiration date and
your holder name.
Just remember that this is just in case your usage exceeds the AWS free tier limit.
And so if that's the case you will be billed but otherwise you just put your credit card number and you
should remain within a free tier and you're not going to pay a cent.
So just put that here. After this you need to provide a valid phone number because you will get a phone
verification.
Next choose a plan for support.
We're going to go with a basic plan because it's free.
And finally you're free to sign it into your account.
