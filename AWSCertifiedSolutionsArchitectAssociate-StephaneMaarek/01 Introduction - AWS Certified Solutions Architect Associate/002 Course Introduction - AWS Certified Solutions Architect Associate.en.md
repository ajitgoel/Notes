Hello and welcome to the AWS certified Solutions Architect associate course.
My name is Stephane Maarek and I'll be your instructor for this class.
So I'm just asking for five minutes of your time before we get started.
I promise no boring stuff will get right into AWS.
but I just want to make sure you and I have the same expectations about this course.
So we're going to prepare for the certification and you'll learn everything you need to know to pass
the exam.
It's a challenging certification so it won't be easy.
And this course will be long about 17 hours.
But I promise you will be very interesting and you will learn a ton of stuff before you get started.
I need you to have basic I.T. knowledge.
I'm sorry I won't be able to teach you everything about a IT but I promise I will teach you everything
about AWS.
So this course contains videos of two kinds.
There is some videos from my developer and SysOps course and it says because some knowledge is shared
between the three certification on AWS
So if you hear me say developer certification or SysOps certification don't worry it's also applicable
to this course.
And I've also created what I think is the most exciting content of this course which is its content
specific to the solutions architect exam and we'll be having hours and hours of solution architecture
discussion that I think no other course other than this one has.
We will cover over 30 AWS services so there's a lot to learn.
So if you're an AWS or I.T. beginner you're welcome to start with this course but take your time.
It's not a race.
And I want you to really know the services well.
One at a time so spend spend maybe four weeks two months with this course.
OK.
So why should you learn from me.
Well I passed a certification recently and had ninety eight point two percent which is out of 1000.
Only one mistake.
So overall I think I'm going to be a great teacher for you.
So before we get started in this course maybe you don't even know what AWS is.
Let me just tell you this in one slide it's Amazon Web Services and it's a cloud provider.
And what does a cloud provider what is basically a service that provides you servers and services on
demand that scale easily.
So three people can maintain an application that scales to five million people around the world.
AWS has revolutionized I.T. over time so it is really different from traditional I.T. and that's what
we'll learn in this course and empower some of the biggest Web sites in this world.
For example Amazon dot com Netflix and so many others.
So what are we going to learn in this course.
There are so many technologies and I don't want you to get scared right now but there's so much you're
going to learn.
And don't worry we'll go progressively step by step at the right level for all of these technologies.
This is what I'm saying you should take your time with this course really make sure you do understand
and one by one and feel free to revisit this course in time when you need to learn again about a new
technology.
So my goal really is to help you navigate the AWS spaghetti bowl it's something I'd like to call it
this way because there are so many services and they're all and tangled and so we will go one by one.
Don't worry if I mention a service you haven't heard yet.
Don't worry it'll come up later.
But so far I'll do my best to navigate you through this AWS.
It's a lake of technologies really.
And I think you're at the right place.
I'm really excited to teach it AWS to you.
Let's get started.
