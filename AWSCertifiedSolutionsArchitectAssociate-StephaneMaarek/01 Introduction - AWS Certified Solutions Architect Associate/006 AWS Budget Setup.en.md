<v Lecturer>Okay so just before we start this course</v>
I want to get started and create an AWS Budget.
This is to monitor if you go over the free tier
and if that's the case, you will get an email alert
and that will be great for you
not to overspend some money.
So for this, go on your account
and click on My Billing Dashboard.
And you are getting into the Billing dashboard,
you can see your current spend,
zero to-date which is great.
But on the left-hand side under Cost Management,
there is Budgets and this is where we are going
to create our first AWS Budget.
For this, click on Create a budget
and we're going to choose a Cost budget.
Next, we click on Set your budget
and here I'm just going to call our budget Learning AWS.
It's going to be a monthly budget
and a recurring one
and we can set up a fixed amount.
So you need to say how much money
you're willing to put every month to learn AWS.
You know a good amount to get started is 10
and 10 will basically ensure
that you don't go overspend $10 in any month,
which is a good way to get started
but if you don't wanna spend any money
and you want to be aware as soon as anything is spent,
that means anything you go over the free tier,
then you can put 0.01 and that means
that as soon as you spend one cent,
AWS will send you an email.
Okay, so this is good enough,
I'll say one cent, just in case.
And click on Configure alerts.
Okay, now you have alerts that you can send.
Do you wanna send the alerts based on the actual costs
or on the forecasted cost?
So here I'll just say on the actual cost.
And you can set a threshold,
for example when you reach 80% of your budget amount.
So I'll say 100% of the budget amount.
And then you send the email you wanna have
to notify, so stephan@example.com.
And when you're done with this,
you click on Confirm budget.
Here, you can review your costs
so again, remember that we're not going to spend
any money this course but there's a chance
that if you do something wrong, you will spend money.
Remember that the certification does cost you
a little bit of money so I would suggest
you can have a budget amount of at least $10, just in case.
You shouldn't spend $10 but maybe you will
if you wanna learn AWS properly.
And so here in this case, just a budget amount of $0.01.
The budget looks good, everything looks perfect
and I'll just go ahead and click on Create.
And here we go, my first budget has been created
and now if I go over this one cent
I will receive an email from AWS and I can take action,
for example I will be able to look at my bills
and under Bills I will be able to see
for that one month where that dollar is coming from,
where my spend is coming from,
which will allow you to drill down into the source
and the root cause of your spends.
So that's it, we're now ready to learn AWS.
Let's get started.
