<v Instructor>So during this course we are doing our best</v>
to stay on the free tier, but, in case you get charges
and you don't know why, I want to show you how you can
get to the bottom of them.
So if you go to the billing, in the management console,
on the left-hand side you will find bills.
And so these bills represent
what you are going to pay every month.
So let's take, for example, my bill in the month of April,
or my bill in the month of March,
which I think is a bit bigger.
Okay, so I have a bill and I have paid 19.03,
that's normal because I'm preparing courses and preparing
good content for you.
And so I want to know where this, in money, comes from.
So if I scroll down,
I can see the AWS service charges by service.
And so I can see, for example,
that the elastic compute cloud was billed $8.13.
And in the region EU Ireland,
I had this much of t2.micro instance hours,
and this much of EBS volume
and this much of elastic load balancing.
That's because I'm above the free tier.
And so, if you have something similar,
you have charges and you don't
know where they're coming from,
the best way is to go to your bills,
find the right month, look at the charges
and then drill down into AWS service charges
to figure out where the charges are coming from,
which region they're coming from
and how much they were.
And this is how you can fix, on your own, these charges,
and this is a very valuable skill to have on AWS.
Hopefully, let's get started with this course
and if you get any charges
remember to come back to this lecture
to know how to resolve them.
All right, that's it, I will see you
in the next lecture.
