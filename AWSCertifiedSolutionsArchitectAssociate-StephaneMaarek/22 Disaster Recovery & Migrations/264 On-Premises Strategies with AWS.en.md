Okay.
So yet another theoretical lecture but I still want you mentioned it because I think it's extremely
important going to the exam you need to know about the services that the U.S. offers at a very very
high level.
But just here one about them wants to do on premise strategy with the cloud.
So we have the ability to download the Amazon and it's 2 a.m. I as a virtual machine and there will
be in the ISO formats and you can load this iso image into the common software used to create the Ms.
So that includes VM where K VM virtual box which is Oracle VM or Microsoft hypervisor.
And this would allow you to run Amazon the next to on your on premise infrastructure they're actually
using that VM.
So that means that you can make it work with some user data and so on.
So quite cool thing about then we have a feature called VM import and export.
And what this allows you to do is to migrate your existing VMs and applications into easy to they're
actually using this feature and you can also create a for example a disaster recovery repository strategy.
If you had a lot of on premise VM but you wanted to back them up into the cloud and because it got imports
and exports you can export back the MS from easy to to your on premise environment if you wanted to.
Now for the obvious application discovery service.
Well this is a service that allows you to gather information about your on premise servers and plan
and migration is a very high level but it does give you some severe visualization information and dependency
mappings and that could be quite helpful when you want to do a massive migration from on premise to
the cloud.
Finally you can track all that migration using the ideal U.S. migration hub.
Then we have areas that are based migration service or DNS which allows you to replicate from on premise
to it.
Yes it does your best or it was to on premise for your database.
So this is quite nice because if you had a mice equal or a Postgres database running on premise and
you wanted to start moving your workload into it yes you could use DNS to replicate the database.
In the meantime and when you're ready you can fully transition to using alias only.
And the nice thing about it is a work with various database technologies that includes Oracle my sequel
The name would be et cetera and allow you to do some really kind of fancy use cases for example and
migrate data from my sequel Into denim would you be okay.
And then finally you have enabled us server migration service or S and S and this is for incremental
replication of on premise Live servers to.
Yes.
So you can replicate the volumes directly into ATO us.
And this is used for more ongoing type of replication.
Okay incremental replication.
And this is the last one that I have in my mind for on premise migration to us.
So at a high level you may be like oh this is a lot of services.
Just remember the names at a high level.
So it looks to on on premise as possible we can do VM import and export for on premise and easy to we
can have migration services such as application discovery Service NWS migration hub database migration
service and server Immigration Service DNS and as an S and just remember this at a high level that's
just so you can see if you see the name in the question then you're not taken by surprise.
Okay.
You know that all these things have to relate to on premise.
Okay.
Well that's it for this short theory lecture I will see you in the next lecture.
