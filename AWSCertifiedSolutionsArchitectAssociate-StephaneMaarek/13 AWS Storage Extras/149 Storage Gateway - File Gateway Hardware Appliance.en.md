<v Instructor>Okay, so just a small addition</v>
to the previous lecture.
So there is this option I haven't talked about,
but that now it comes up in the exam,
which is called the file gateway hardware appliance.
So using the file gateway, I told you
you need to use visualization, but you have an alternative.
You can also install a file gateway hardware appliance
directly on premises to synchronize your files
from on premises into AWS.
So as you can see, in the console,
you'll see the host platform.
So the first four options
are going to be virtual appliances,
but the last one is a hardware appliance,
and you actually have to go on amazon.com and buy it.
It looks like this
and you can plug it in your own small data center
and have it do the job of transferring your files from
your on premises environment into AWS through the NFS.
So the use case for it that comes up in the exam
is that if you have a small data center
with no visualization capability
and you still need to perform a daily NFS backup,
then the answer is to buy and a hardware appliance
and plug it onto your small data center,
and using the hardware appliance,
you can do your daily NFS backup.
So that's it, a very short lecture,
but hopefully, that helps you for the exam,
and I will see you in the next lecture.
