<v ->So so far we've been learning</v>
all about individual technologies,
but here we're going to learn
how they fit together.
And so we're going to view solution architectures,
now this is to me the best part of this course
so really this is the part I'm most
proud of is, okay.
No one does that,
how do we look and how do we see
how these technologies all fit together,
all work together into
a solution architecture.
So you need to be 100 percent comfortable
with everything I'm going to explain
in this section going into the exam
because this is pure solution architecture.
So to discuss this we'll be discussing
particularly how you can think of solution
architecture overall, iteratively,
through simple case studies.
We'll see whatisthetime.com,
myclothes.com, mywordpress.com,
how to instantiate applications
quickly, and Beanstalk.
So overall it will be a natural
progression, it will be increasingly complex.
But hopefully it will give you some good perspective on
EC2 vs ELB,
vs ASG vs EBS,
EFS, RDS, Elastic, H--
All these kind of things, Enroute
(mumbles)
how all they fit together.
Okay that's it,
let's get started with solution architecture.
