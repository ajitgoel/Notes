<v Instructor>Okay so in case you want to</v>
protect yourself from DDoS attacks,
which are distributed denial-of-service attacks,
then you need to use AWS Shield.
And it comes in two flavors.
The first one is AWS Shield Standard,
which is a free service that is going to be activated
by default for every AWS customers,
and it's going to protect you from attacks
such as SYN/UDP floods, reflection attacks,
and other layer three or layer four attacks.
If you have no idea what I'm talking about, that's okay.
Just remember that shield standard is free,
activated for every AWS customers
and it protects you from DDoS attacks.
And then you have Shield Advanced,
which is another level of service,
and it gives you a DDoS mitigation service
which is $3,000 per month per organization,
and it protects you against more sophisticated attacks
on your Amazon EC2, ELB, CloudFront,
Global Accelerator, and Route 53 services.
Okay.
And you also get access 24/7
to a DDoS response team which is called DRP.
And finally, in case you have higher fees
because you have a Load Balancer and those kind of groups
that scales a lot and so on,
because you have a DDoS,
then all the higher fees are being waived
because you are updated to choose for AWS Shield Advanced.
Okay.
So very simple, there's no hands-on in this lecture.
All that we need to remember is that there's Shield Standard
by default free, and protects you against DDoS
on EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and Route 53.
And then there's Shield Advanced
if you want to have a team to help you with the DDoS,
and you wanna protect yourself against higher fees.
Alright, that's it for shields.
I will see you in the next lecture.
