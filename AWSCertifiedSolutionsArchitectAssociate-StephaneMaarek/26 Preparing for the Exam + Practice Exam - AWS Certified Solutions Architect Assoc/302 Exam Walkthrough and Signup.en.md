<v Man>And now is the time</v>
to sign up for your certification.
And for this, you go to this website,
AWS training/certification,
and then you click on sign in.
You have to create an account for Amazon
or sign in user accounts.
But as you mentioned, it's not for AWS
it is an Amazon account, so make sure you have one,
but you can just create one it's fairly easy.
After you're sign in you're redirected to the screen
and then to get your certification,
you click on, go to your accounts.
Okay, so I'm going to show you
how to just schedule the exam,
but first just know that in the next lecture,
I go over the benefits tabs.
And this tab is that if you have already passed an exam
in AWS, you can get 50% discount on your next exam.
So please make sure to watch the next lecture,
to see how to do this.
Now, to set up an exam, you have two options.
You can either use Pearson VUE or PSI.
And both have their own network of testing centers
that are physical.
So you need to go into a testing center,
so you can see if Pearson VUE or PSI is better.
But one of them, Pearson VUE
allows you to get your exam online, okay?
So someone is going to watch you on camera
and actually make you pass your examination
directly from your home office,
if you're alone in your room.
So we are going to see both.
So in case you want to schedule on your exam,
you can just click on the schedule new exam.
Now, there's a big note here that says
that if you are requesting an exam accommodation,
to get an extra 30 minutes on your test,
because you're not an English native,
then you can not schedule an exam with Pearson VUE online,
you have to call them on your phone.
So this is also something I show you in the next lecture,
how to request an exam accommodation.
So please make sure to watch the next lecture,
but also please make sure that if you do enable
to get an exam accommodation,
you will need to schedule an exam
with Pearson VUE via phone.
And Pearson VUE's as the only examination center
that is allowing you to get on an exam.
So that may be a problem for you.
Okay, so now we can have a look at how to schedule an exam.
So if you scroll down this page,
you see the list of all the examinations available to you.
And for example,
if you look at certified developer associates,
you can click here to schedule it with BSI.
And then from this page, you can find your exam you want.
So we said certified developer, which is right here,
you would click on schedule exam, English.
And then you can find a test location in your area
and finally get through the checkouts.
So PSI is for your in-person onsite exam centers
and due to COVID-19, it may be a problem for you
to schedule an exam in person.
So the other alternative is to go with Pearson VUE.
So for example, I'm gonna do
solutions, architects, associates with Pearson VUE.
So I click here and I can go ahead
and schedule it on their website.
Now, Pearson VUE allows you to get both in-person
or at home for a test center.
So as you can see here,
you can take at a local test center or at home or office.
So this is in-person again,
so exam centers may be closed due to COVID-19,
but this is at home, which is a popular option.
So then you click on run pre-check
to you make sure that your computer is ready,
then you click on next and you would be able to go ahead
with scheduling your exam.
So fairly simple, you just have to accept
just a bunch of clauses,
choose your language for your exam.
And then you would be able to select
a time and a date for your exam.
Now, please note that this is going to be at home.
So if you schedule it and make sure to show up
maybe 30 minutes in advance,
just to make sure your computer is ready,
and to makes sure that you are ready to start your exam.
You would have to go directly into the Pearson VUE website
to get your exams.
So here I can schedule other exams,
but I think I'll be good, one is enough.
Find your dates and find your time.
And then you're good to go to go ahead and pay.
And then when you are ready to take your exam,
you would go to upcoming exams
and you click on manage Pearson VUE exam,
and this would allow you to find where your exam is
and to start it online.
You would see it here in this UI.
Okay, so that's it.
I hope you liked this lecture
and I will see you in the next lecture.
