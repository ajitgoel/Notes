in the serverless world is called SAM,
and SAM stands for Serverless Application Model,
and it's a little squirrel as your logo.
So it's a framework for developing
and deploying serverless applications
and all the configuration of your serverless applications
is going to be done in YAML code.
That means that through the same framework,
you can configure your Lambda functions,
your DynamoDB tables, your API Gateway,
your Cognito User Pools,
and SAM will help you deploy that automatically.
So on top of this, on top of helping you deploy
all these applications to the AWS Cloud in a natural way,
SAM can help you run your Lambda functions,
your API Gateway, and your DynamoDB tables locally
on your computer so you can do some debugging.
Finally, SAM allows you to quickly
deploy your Lambda functions
using the integration with Code Deploy.
So this is just a quick overview.
This is more something you have to do a deep dive on
when you are into the certified developer exam.
But SAM at a high level is a framework
to manage your applications, your serverless applications,
and it allows you to deploy your Lambda functions,
and DynamoDB tables, API Gateway, and Cognito User Pools.
That's it, that's all you need to know going into the exam,
so if you see SAM now, you know what that means.
All right, that's it, I will see you in the next lecture.
