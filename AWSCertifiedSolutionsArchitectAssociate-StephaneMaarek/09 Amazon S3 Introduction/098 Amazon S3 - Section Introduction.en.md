<v ->Okay, welcome to this last section</v>
on the AWS fundamentals.
This section is actually one of the most important.
It is a very popular subject at the exam.
It is Amazon S3.
Amazon S3 powers the biggest websites in the world
and you probably don't even know about it.
In this section we're going to learn all you need to know
to use S3 properly and securely.
<v Man>So Amazon S3 is going to be</v>
one of the most important building blocks of AWS,
and we'll use it at length during this course.
It will be advertised as an infinitely scaling storage
so we don't need to provision its size in advance,
and it can grow infinitely or so they say.
It's extremely popular and it has its own section
actually also has an advanced section on it very soon,
so you have lots to learn on Amazon S3.
Something you may not know is that
many websites in the world will use Amazon S3 as a backbone,
so we'll see how we can deploy websites on Amazon S3
and so many AWS resources
have an integration with Amazon S3 as well.
<v ->This is going to be a fascinating section.</v>
I hope you're excited.
I will see you in the next lecture.
