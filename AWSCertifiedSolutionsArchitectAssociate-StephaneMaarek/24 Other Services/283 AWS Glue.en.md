<v Instructor>Ok so, AWS Glue is a service by AWS</v>
and this service is a weird name
but what it does is it does ETL.
So ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load
and what does that mean is that you are able
to move data from various data sources into
other data as targets wherever you want.
And through this process you're able
to transform it, clean it, change the data format
et cetera, et cetera.
So you can maybe do analytics on it.
So if you see Glue at the examine question
that means ETL and so that's all you need you know
going into the exam.
So the idea is that because it's managed,
you can automate all the time consuming steps
of preparation for data analytics
and it's serverless, it's pay as you go, fully managed,
and in the back any works with Apache Spark which is good,
really, really good performance.
And it has a capability to crawl data sources.
So if you provide a database it will be able
to find all the data sources, all the tables,
all the data formats using schema inference.
And finally it gives you automated co-generation
if you want to take that Apache Spark code
and customize it a little bit.
So in terms of sources what can it do.
Well Aurora already has Redshift and history are good
sources, engines of Sinks, S three, Redshift, et cetera.
I mean it does pretty much anything to anything.
So finally there's this thing called the glue data catalog
and it's basically to compare
to comprise all the metadata.
So the definition in the scheme
of all the source tables in your infrastructure
and that be used by EMR as well.
So Glue remember, fully managed ETL,
it's serverless, it provides co-generation
and there is this Glue data catalog.
So that's it, no hands on
and I will see you in the next lecture.
