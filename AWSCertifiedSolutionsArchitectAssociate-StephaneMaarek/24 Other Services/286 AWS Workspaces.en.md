<v Instructor>Alright, so let's talk about AWS WorkSpaces.</v>
It is a managed secure cloud desktop,
so that's a lot of keywords in here,
but basically if unpremised you are provisioning VDI
and it's called Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.
Then you knew it was a lot of management
to basically deploy these environments,
and so WorkSpaces allow you
to just get On Demand a cloud desktop,
and you're going to pay just for usage.
So if you use it for one hour,
you're going to pay for just one hour
of this secure cloud desktop.
So basically it just provides you On Demand access
to virtual desktops, which is awesome.
It's going to be secure, encrypted,
it's going to be network isolation,
and it's integrated with Microsoft Active Directory.
That means that if you're using a Microsoft account
to basically access your VDIs
then you can use that same account
to access your secure cloud desktop with WorkSpaces.
So, concretely, what does that mean?
That means that you as a user can get
a desktop provisioned through WorkSpaces.
So here we go, we have a desktop being provisioned,
most likely it's going to be Windows,
but now there's support for Linux as well,
and so from that desktop,
which is a secure connection from you and desktop,
maybe you can access securely your corporate
data center infrastructure,
or maybe you can access securely your AWS Cloud resources.
So it is a great way of having a tight management,
a tight security, and making sure that your users
can work from anywhere securely using controlled desktops.
So at the exam when we use WorkSpaces,
well usually when you see the word VDI for example,
how do you place a VDI infrastructure where WorkSpaces
is that kind of answer, okay?
Secure log, and stop, replacement of VDIs.
That's it, it's so simple, but it's really helpful
I've used that service actually with one of my clients,
and it made everything so much easier to access
their resources in their corporate data center
in a secure fashion.
Alright, that's all for this lecture.
I will see you in the next lecture.
