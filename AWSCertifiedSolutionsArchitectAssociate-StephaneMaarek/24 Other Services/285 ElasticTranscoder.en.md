<v Narrator>So Elastic Transcoder is a way for you</v>
to convert media files, so video and music.
They're stored into S3, and you can transform them
into various formats, different size, different templates,
different formats physically, that it can be optimized
for tablets, PCs, Smartphone and TV.
So what will you use Elastic Transcoder?
Well it has a lot of features,
that come out of the box,
it can optimize the bit rates, create thumbnails,
create watermarks for your video, creates captions,
creates protections with DRM, progressive download
and even encryption.
So it's something that you may wanna use on the AWS side.
So four components of Elastic Transcoder,
the first one is a job and the job physically
describes what the work of the Transcoder is.
The pipeline, which is a queue to manage
all the transcoding jobs.
The presets, which is physically the templates
for converting media from one format to another.
So you would say, this size, this quality, this bit rate
and then finally notifications, if you wanted
to have SNS notifications, when a transcoding job is done.
Finally, this is kind of this server-less service,
on the AWS side, so you pay for what you use.
It scales automatically and it's fully managed,
so it's a really good decision
to have in your server-less pipelines.
So remember, when you see Elastic Transcoder,
think converting media files
and that's all you need going into the exam.
Alright, I will see in the next lecture.
