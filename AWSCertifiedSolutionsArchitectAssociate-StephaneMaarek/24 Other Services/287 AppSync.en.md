<v Narrator>AppSync is a service to store and sync data</v>
across mobile and web apps in real time.
So, if you look at the logo on the right hand side
I think it makes it pretty obvious.
Even the name for once, on the AWS service is pretty
obvious what it does.
It synchronizes data between your mobile and web apps
in real time.
So, what does it work, how does it work?
Well, it makes the users of GraphQL, and GraphQL is a mobile
technology straight out of Facebook and it is really
revolutionary, but we don't go in depth into
this GraphQL thing today.
But, basically the idea is that AppSync
is a managed GraphQL.
So the client code can be generated automatically, there is
integration with DynamoDB, Lambda, there is real time
subscriptions, offline data synchronization, and
that's an alternative for Cognito Sync, and finally you
get Fine Grained Security.
So, going into the exam, when you see synchronizing data
between mobile and web apps in real time it is
going to be either Cognito Synch or AppSync, and if
you see GraphQL, how do we do GraphQL on AWS, then it is
going to be AppSync for sure.
Okay, that is all you need to know going into the exam,
it's actually very complicated technology, but at a high
level you can understand what it does pretty easily.
So, that's it, I will see you in the next lecture.
