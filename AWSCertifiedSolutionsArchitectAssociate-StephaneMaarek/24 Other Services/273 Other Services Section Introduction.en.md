Welcome to one of the final sections of this course this section is a little bit special because
I'm going to mention other technologies that may be coming up at the exam for one or two questions but there
are going to be very basic questions.
So this lecture will not be a deep dive into all of these topics it's just going to be an overview of
a few services. Overall as exam evolves and changes
I will make sure to add the appropriate lectures in this section. But everything you need to know today is already
here.
I guarantee you this.
So let's get started and learn about the few other services.
