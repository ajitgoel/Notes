 Okay hello loggers and welcome to this lecture. 
 This lecture is on the different rooting policies available for Route 53 and we're just going to have 
 a look at them and then we're going to jump in and do a lap on each one of them. 
 So the following reading policies are available at 53. 
 We have simple recruiting. 
 We have a weighted rating. 
 We have a latency base rooting we have fail over rating. 
 We have geo location rating. 
 We have geo proximity rooting for traffic flow only. 
 And we have multi value and so rooting so to get started. 
 We're going to start with the simplest rooting policy and that is simple ratings. 
 If you've got the time. 
 Please join me in the next lecture. 
 Thank you.
