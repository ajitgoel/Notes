 Okay. 
 Hello bloggers and welcome to this lecture. 
 So this lecture is for Udemy students only. 
 And I'm gonna show you how to find the resources for individual lectures because Udemy has changed the 
 UI and some students have been complaining that they can't find the resources. 
 So let's go over to Udemy. 
 Okay so I mean one of my courses on udemy the adobe certified Solutions Architect associate course. 
 And if you look down here we can see the different sections you've got Section 1 Section 2 Section 3 
 Section 4. 
 But go to Section 4. 
 We're going to have a bootstrap script here. 
 If we scroll down you'll be able to see if a lecture has a resource it's got a little folder icon if 
 it doesn't have a resource associated with it then it won't have that folder icon and then all you need 
 to do is click in here and then you can download the resources if there are any resources missing in. 
 If I say it's available in the resources section you can't see it. 
 Please let us know either via Linked In or via Twitter it's probably the best way to get in contact 
 with us or let us know on the cloud guru discussion forums. 
 So that's it for this lecture everyone let's get started learning AWP.
