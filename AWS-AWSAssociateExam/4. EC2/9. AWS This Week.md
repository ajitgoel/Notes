 AK helicopters and welcome to this lecture so hopefully you are learning an awful lot in the course 
 so far and you're starting to understand how complicated AWOS is. 
 Now Harry Cleetus of a famous was an ancient Greek philosopher and he once famously said everything 
 changes and Nothing stands still. 
 And then you start learning AWOS are you going to realize how much it changes all of the time. 
 There's literally thousands of new product updates and releases each year and can be really really hard 
 to keep up. 
 And we have a web series called AWOS this week which is basically a weekly show discussing all the new 
 updates to AWOS for the week. 
 It's five minutes or less so when won't take a lot of time. 
 We haven't explained it like I'm 5 or courage or something really complicated comes out we'll try and 
 break it down and help you understand what it is and what it means to you as either solutions architect 
 a developer This admin or business leader or whatever it is in whatever role that you do. 
 So the best way to stay up to date with AWOS and all the constant changes.
